## IRC Client-Server

Internet Relay Chat Client & Server programmed by William Harrington in Python for CS494 project. Requires python 2.7.9 or earlier.
Coding style adheres to PEP 0008 guidelines.

## Client

python chat_client.py host port username

## Server

python chat_server.py

## Test server

I currently have a server running just for testing purposes. Connect to it with chat_client.py by doing the following: python chat_client.py 131.252.208.28 6667 username

When you connect type /help for a list of commands.
You will also find that there is also a channel with a "ChanServ" bot in it. 
When you say ChanServ to it, it will respond. Try asking it 'how are you'.
