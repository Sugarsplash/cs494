Abstract

   The goal of this project is to develop and demonstrate a working IRC
   protocol and implementing an IRC client and server in python. IRC is
   a text‐based protocol that allows IRC clients to send messages to
   eachother over a socket connection to the IRC server. This
   implementation of the IRC protocol will support multiple clients and
   multiple chat rooms.

INTERNET DRAFT        Internet Relay Chat Protocol              May 2015


1  Introduction

   This protocol is intented to provide a means of text based
   communication between clients via a central server in a client‐server
   model. This protocol will operate over the TCP/IP protocols to
   connect clients and servers over TCP socket connections. The
   functionality of this protocol will be demonstrated by setting up a
   single process as the server which will form a central point for
   clients to connect to. Clients will send messages or commands to the
   server to be delivered or executed.

1.1  Server

   The IRC server will allow clients to establish socket connections.
   The server will monitor the all of the socket connections that have
   been established by clients for messages or commands. The server will
   then deliver messages to clients or execute commands for clients.
   Commands to be executed will include user creation, login, view
   users, view rooms, join room, leave room, create room, list room
   members, and logout. This will require the server to maintain a list
   of users. This list of users will be a data structure used to track
   connection and room membership. The server will also need to maintain
   a list of rooms. This list of rooms will consist of a data structure
   to track the users who are in the room.

1.2 Client

   The IRC client will need to establish a TCP socket connection to the
   IRC server and forward stdin to the IRC server. The client will also
   need to display messages from the server on stdout. Clients will be
   able to log in to a user or create a new user. Clients will be able
   to view all logged in users and all rooms. Clients will be able to
   join, create, and leave rooms. Clients will be able send messages to
   all clients within a room. Clients will be able to logout.

2.  The IRC Specification

2.1 Overview

   The protocol as described herein is for use only with client to
   server connections when the client registers as a user.

2.2 Connections

   Connections will be established between clients and a server over
   TCP/IP socket connections. This application will be implemented in
   the python language and will utilize the socket class and library to
   create connections.

2.3 Rooms

   Rooms will be created by commands issued from user clients and
   executed by the server. A room will simply be a list of users
   currently joined.  A list of all rooms will need to be maintained by
   the server.

2.4 Users

   Users will be created upon request of a client to the server. The
   server will maintain a list of all users. The list of users will
   consist of user entries. Each entry will contain a connection and
   rooms field. Upon creation of a user, the server must create an entry
   in the user list and update the user entry connection information to
   the client connection.  Upon successful login, the server must update
   the user entry connection information to the client connection. Upon
   successful logout, the user entry must have the connection
   information set to NULL. Upon joining or leaving a room, the user
   entry room field must be updated.

2.5 Messages

   Messages will be input from stdin on client machines that will be a
   accessed by the server over the socket connection and handled by the
   server. Messages may either be a command for the server to process,
   or a message for the server to deliver. Commands will be identified
   by a command prefix that must begin any command a user wishes to
   execute. All messages that do not begin with the command prefix will
   be interpreted as messages to be delivered to the appropriate room.

2.6 Commands

   All commands must begin with the command prefix in order to be
   handled the server. The following commands may be issued by clients:

      create_user: Server will create a user entry in the user list and
                   update the new user entry name to the specified
                   username and the connection to the client socket.

          Usage:   <command prefix>create_user <desired username>

      login: Server will update the connection field of the user entry
             specified to the client socket.

          Usage:   <command prefix>login <username>

      users: Server will return a list of all users with a connections
             entry to the client. If a room name is given in the OPTION
             field, the server will return a list of users in the given
             room.

          Usage:   <command prefix>users ‐[OPTION]

      rooms: Server will return a list of all rooms to the client.

          Usage:   <command prefix>rooms


The following commands may be issued by users:

      join_room: Server will add the desired room to the users rooms
                 list.

          Usage:   <command prefix>join_room <room name>

      create_room: Server will add the room specified to the rooms
                   list. The server will then add the user to the
                   newly created room with the join_room procedure.

          Usage:   <command prefix>create_room <room name>


      leave_room: Server will remove the desired room to the users rooms
                 list.

          Usage:   <command prefix>leave_room <room name>


      logout: Server will set the connection field of the user entry to
              NULL.

          Usage:   <command prefix>logout <username>

3  Possible Features

      Additional features may be added to this protocol given time
      constraints. If a full implementation is complete, effort will
      be made to implement file transfer, private messaging, and secure
      connections will be attempted in that order.
